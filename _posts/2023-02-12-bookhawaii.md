Recently, Auburn University hosted "AuburnHacks," an annual 24-hour programming competition. My team and I developed **BookHawaii**, a web application designed to make planning a trip to Hawaii seamless and enjoyable. This project was a fantastic opportunity to integrate various tools and resources, showcasing our proficiency in web development.

## Inspiration Behind BookHawaii

Our team was inspired by the tropical allure of Hawaii. We aimed to create a platform that not only provided essential information about this paradise but also embodied its vibrant and inviting spirit. Most importantly, the competition was tropical themed.

## What BookHawaii Offers

**BookHawaii** serves as a one-stop destination for anyone planning a trip to Hawaii. It features:

- **Destination Insights:** Detailed information on popular spots in Hawaii.

## Our Development Journey

Building **BookHawaii** was both challenging and rewarding. Here's a glimpse into our process:

- **Project Management:** We used GitHub Projects for organizing our development workflow.
- **Code Repository:** Our code was stored and managed in a GitHub repository.
- **Back-End Development:** Django was our choice for the back-end, coupled with Django templates for the front-end.
- **Hosting and Domain:** The server was hosted on Digital Ocean, with the domain acquired from Domain.com.
- **Database Management:** MongoDB Atlas was used for storing city and weather data.
- **API Integration:** We utilized Weatherapi.com for weather data and Flyscanner API for flight costs.
- **Front-End Design:** MDBootstrap provided the HTML templates, which we customized for our needs.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Repl.it facilitated real-time HTML and Python collaboration.
- **Automated Updates:** We used crontabs to run a Python script that regularly updated the weather database.

## Challenges and Learning

The journey wasn't without its hurdles:

- **API Integration:** Finding a suitable flight information API was tough.
- **HTML Learning Curve:** Our initial lack of HTML experience posed a challenge.
- **Data Parsing:** Parsing the correct forecast from WeatherAPI required effort.
- **Access Issues:** Auburn's WiFi restrictions led us to use a VPN for website access.

Despite these challenges, we're proud of our clean, user-friendly website and successful API integrations.

## My Role in the Project

I focused on the back-end design using Django. I was responsible for integrating MongoDB and implementing Django templates to bring my partner's HTML designs to life.

## Looking Ahead

This project was a significant learning experience, especially in database integration and security. I'm excited to apply these skills in future projects and continue exploring the vast possibilities in web development.
