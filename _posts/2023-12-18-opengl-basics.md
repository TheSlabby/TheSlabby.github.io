# Exploring OpenGL: The WalkerOGL Project

I'm excited to share my latest project, **WalkerOGL**. This endeavor is a testament to my interest in computer graphics and my journey in learning OpenGL. The project is a work in progress, where I am developing my own rendering engine using GLAD and GLFW.

## Project Overview

**WalkerOGL** started as an experiment with basic OpenGL functionalities. Here's a glimpse of what I've accomplished so far:

- **Initial Rendering:** Started with rendering a simple triangle to understand the basics.
- **Progression to 3D:** Implemented perspective projection to render a 3D cube.
- **Camera Controls:** Added simple camera controls to navigate around the 3D space.

## Current Focus

Currently, I'm working on implementing a basic lighting engine. The goal is to integrate phong lighting to enhance the realism and depth of the rendered objects.

## Code Highlights

The project's core lies in its GLSL shaders:
- Vertex Shader: `VertexShader.glsl`
- Fragment Shader: `FragmentShader.glsl`

These shaders are pivotal in rendering the graphics and will play a significant role in the upcoming lighting features.

## Contribute and Explore

I'm always open to contributions and feedback. Feel free to dive into the code, suggest improvements, or share your ideas.

Stay tuned for more updates as I continue to explore the fascinating world of OpenGL and computer graphics!
