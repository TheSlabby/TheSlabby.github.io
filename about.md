# Welcome!

I'm Walker, a Computer Engineering student at Auburn University, diving deep into the world of computer graphics, cybersecurity, and game development.

## About Me

With a keen interest in C++ and OpenGL, I'm passionate about creating and innovating in the realm of computer graphics. I'm also actively exploring cybersecurity, understanding how to protect and strengthen digital systems.

As a creator, I've ventured into the world of Minecraft mods and plugins, bringing interactive experiences to life. When I'm not coding, I'm likely strategizing in a game of League of Legends or keeping up with the latest in house music.

## My Work

Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, ranging from robust Minecraft modifications to intricate cybersecurity solutions. Each project showcases my dedication to learning and applying my skills in real-world scenarios.
